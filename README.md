# betPawa Wallet

ThisÂ consists of a wallet server and a wallet client. The wallet server will keeps track
of a users monetary balance in the system. The client emulates users depositing and
withdrawing funds.

## Run Wallet Server :

Steps to run Wallet Server on your local machine.
(*Make sure you have MySQL installed on your system.*)

1. Create a database in MySQL with name betPawa
2. Make following changes in application.properties
    spring.datasource.username={Your MySQL user}
    spring.datasource.password={Your MySQL Password}
3. Navigate to bPwallet folder and run ./gradlew bootRun(mac/linux) or gradlew.bat bootRun(Windows)
4. Create 1st user with endpoint.
    http://localhost:8080/user?name=AnyUsername
5. The Server is up and running.


## Run Integration Tests :

Once you have started the server and created a user, you can run the integration test.

1. Navigate to bPwallet folder and run ./gradlew integrationTest(mac/linux) and gradlew.bat integrationTest(Windows)
2. After the test is executed, report will be generated.
Go to bPwallet/build/reports/tests/integrationTest/index.html to see results.


## Run Client :

Once you have started the server, start a new terminal/cmd and navigate to bWallet folder.

Run ./gradlew startClient(mac/linux) and gradlew.bat startClient(windows)

### Withdraw API - 

/betpawa/wallet/withdraw?userId=1&amount=100&currency=USD

### Balance API - 

/betpawa/wallet/balance?userId=1

##### *Server starts up at port 8080


# Important Choices in the solution

1. Whether to make two different applications for Server and Client - As I went throught the requirement I realised that the power of Gradle build can be used to keep the two together and run one as a SpringBoot Web App and other as a CLI app, independent of each other.

2. To Create GET/POST both type of requests for Wallet basic interfaces. Depending upon which client would be consuming it and making it easier for clients.

3. The DB Structure. Which majorly contains User, Wallets and Funds tables.

User Table stores user info and bidirectional relation to wallet table(User table contains Wallets PK & Wallet Tables contains users PK) making sure that each user has one wallet and vice versa.

Wallet Table stores users wallets info and bidirectional relation to Funds table(Wallet table contains Funds PK & Funds Tables contains Wallets PK) making sure that each Wallet has more than one Fund type but, Every Fund has only one wallet.

Funds and Users are not related as there is no point/scenario to fetch users funds directly without a wallet. It should not be done.
